## Learning Objectives

Here's what you will learn by the end of this workshop.


## Generative AI For Beginners

Want a quick introduction to generative AI concepts? Check out the [Generative AI for Beginners](https://aka.ms/genai-beginners) curriculum that takes you from prompt-engineering to productiond deployments with various hands-on applications. Check out [Lesson 18](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/blob/main/18-fine-tuning/README.md) for an introduction to fine-tuning.

!!! tip "Watch the Video"

    In this 20-minute lesson, I walk through the fine-tuning fundamentals with a toy example (something that can complete the fine-tuning within an hour or so) using an OpenAI model. You can walk through this yourself with [the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/tree/main/18-fine-tuning/python/openai) that comes with the course.
